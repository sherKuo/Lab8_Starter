# Lab 8 - Starter
worked by myself, Had fever from 3rd covid booster shot so scheduling was kinda hard.

1. I would fit my automated test within a Github actions that runs whenever the code is pushed because we should be testing often.  This way when we get failed test, we can immediately go in and fix the bugs and exceptions not caught as we work. This also means less debugging at the end cuz we get the work done early. 
2.No, while E2E testing is helpful it is a is a bit of an overpowerwerd method for simbly testing a functions output.  Instead, a simple unit test case for the specific function would work well.
